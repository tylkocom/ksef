## Example Scripts

Runnable examples live in [`scripts/examples`](../scripts/examples).
Run them as modules with `uv run -m ...`; direct execution by file path is not supported.
The guide pages above link to the most relevant scripts for each area.
The structure and conventions for maintaining them are documented in
[`scripts/examples/README.md`](../scripts/examples/README.md).

Good starting points:

- [`scripts/examples/quickstart.py`](../scripts/examples/quickstart.py)
- [`scripts/examples/invoices/send_batch.py`](../scripts/examples/invoices/send_batch.py)
- [`scripts/examples/invoices/submit_batch.py`](../scripts/examples/invoices/submit_batch.py)
- [`scripts/examples/invoices/send_query_export_download.py`](../scripts/examples/invoices/send_query_export_download.py)
- [`scripts/examples/peppol/query_providers.py`](../scripts/examples/peppol/query_providers.py)
- [`scripts/examples/scenarios/session_workflow.py`](../scripts/examples/scenarios/session_workflow.py)
